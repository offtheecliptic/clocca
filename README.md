# Library Clocca

## Introduction

This is a simple library for managing time and date and related concepts such as duration and timezone.

Why 'clocca'?  Because it is the Latin word for bell, which in earlier times was used to indicate to townspeople the passage of time.

## Motivation

Why another library for dates and times? Especially when the Java/Kotlin world has settled on java.time?  Because java.time and other date/time libraries were designed to handle *every* use case related to time and calendar data management. This library is intended for applications that have very simple needs.

## Design Philosopy

Everything is interface-based.

The core data concepts -- date, time, datetime, duration, instant, and timezone -- do not have *any* ties to serialization or deserialization, or to construction (aside from default constructors).  Instead, all sewrde (serializtion-deserialization) is in a separate serde file, and all construction methods are in a separate factories file.

The default implementation is provided by the java.time library.  However, another library could be used in its place.

The serde operations can be used to get the raw objects that the implementation library provides.

No operations are provided for date and time arithmetic.  Deal with it.


## Usage

Maven coordinates: [offtheecliptic/clocca 0.2.0]

### Import Statements

import offtheecliptic.clocca.interfaces.*
import offtheecliptic.clocca.impls.*
import offtheecliptic.clocca.factories.*
import offtheecliptic.clocca.serde.*

## Concepts

These are the key concepts the library deals with.

Date        - Defines a date in a calendar. 

Time        - Defines a time on a clock.

DateTime    - Defines a combination of a date and a time, which, when each is fully specified, defines a single point on a calendar timeline.

TimeZone    - Defines a time zone for binding dates, times,and date-times to a specific longitudinal region of Earth. A time zone consists of two things: an identiifer, in the form of a TimeZoneName, and an offset from the Prime Meridian.  The latter is defined in terms of a Duration, with positive values...

TimeZoneName - An abstraction for dealing with time zones, consisting of a name, and abbreviation, and an optional set of locations in which the time zone is applicable.  [Maybe that shoul dbe in Time Zone, not name.]

Duration     - 

Instant      - A specific point in time, measured from a reference point. The typical reference point is January 1, 1970, as measured from the Prime Meridian. This is the Unix reference point.

### Special Considerations

#### Dates

Partial date    - A date that does not have all the date components (year, month, day).  If any of the components are not provided, the missing one or ones must be at one end of the component sequence.  

Zoned date      - A date that is bound to a specific timezone.

#### Times

Partial time    - A time that does not have all the time components (hour, minute, second, nanosecond).  If any of the components are not provided, the missing one or ones must be at one end of the component sequence.  For example, hour and minute can be missing, but minute alone cannot.  Similarly, second can be missing, as can second and minute, but again, ninute cannot be missing on its own.   

Zoned time      - A time that is bound to a specific timezone.
    
### DateTimes
